x86-sat
===
This is a rudimentary attempt to build an autogenerated formal-ish model of
x86 intrinsics by interpreting Intel's instruction pseudocode, transforming
it into a model for [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

# Description
[Intel's Intrinsics Guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/) provides an interactive
guide with data for each x86 intrinsic instruction, including a pseudocode that specifies the instruction's
behavior. The intrinsics guide is backed by an XML file with all of this data in an easily parseable format,
which we use here to build a Z3 model.

This method is inherently limited. The intrinsics only cover a subset of x86 instructions, so this will mostly be
useful for investigating hand-rolled SIMD code, etc. Handling memory might be possible but would
certainly be very slow. Handling control flow is likely out of scope for now too.

There are quite possibly bugs in this implementation, which can be pretty hard to find and fix.
There are also definitely bugs in Intel's code (see below), so this shouldn't be relied on
for anything serious.

So far, this can do some interesting non-trivial things, like deriving lookup
tables for `vpternlogd`:
```python
check(_mm512_ternarylogic_epi32(_mm512_set1_epi8(0xAA),
       _mm512_set1_epi8(0xCC), _mm512_set1_epi8(0xF0), y) == _mm512_set1_epi8(0x57))
# -> [y = 0x1f]
```
...or finding an index vector for `vpermb` for reversing its input:
```python
values = range(2, 3*64, 3)
check(_mm512_set_epi8(*values) == _mm512_permutexvar_epi8(b, _mm512_set_epi8(*reversed(values))))
# <- [b = 0x000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f1011...]
```
...or **finding a bug in Intel's pseudocode**. Turns out that last one gives `unsat`, which didn't make sense.
Investigating further, I noticed that I wasn't getting the right result for a `_mm512_set_epi8(*range(64))`,
which led me to find this bug in the `_mm512_set_epi8` pseudocode:
```diff
 dst[495:488] := e61
 dst[503:496] := e62
-dst[511:503] := e63
+dst[511:504] := e63
 dst[MAX:512] := 0
```

All of these intrinsic functions used in these examples (and the ones in `example.py`) are completely
autogenerated from Intel's data; there's no manual intrinsics created whatsoever.

# Usage
To use this, you must first download the latest XML from Intel's Intrinsics Guide
(currently here: https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/files/data-3.4.6.xml)
and save it as `data.xml` in the current directory. I don't believe I can legally
redistribute this file myself.

This project requires Z3, and my [sprdpl](https://github.com/zwegner/sprdpl) parsing library
(included as a submodule).
